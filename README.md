# SliceStream

SliceStream aims to develop an interactive user interface for high-quality segmentation and object tracking in videos, with a focus on reducing the reliance on labor-intensive data annotation and initialization. Our goal is to create a basic user interface linked with end-to-end machine learning models capable of targeting and tracking one object at a time.

## Project Overview

### Description
Current methods for video segmentation and object tracking require extensive manual annotation and initialization, limiting their scalability and practicality. SliceStream addresses this challenge by combining machine learning models with an intuitive user interface.

### Expected Progress
Our primary goal for this semester is to create a basic user interface and integrate it with end-to-end machine learning models capable of segmenting and tracking a single object in videos.
