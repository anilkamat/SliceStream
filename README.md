# SliceStream
SliceStreamâ€™s goal is to create an interactive user interface for high-quality segmentation and object tracking in a video. Current methods heavily rely on labor-intensive data annotation and initialization, limiting their scalability and practicality.

# Milestones
Design and create the front end UI for feeding in video and selecting an object to track.

Develop end-to-end machine learning models for video segmentation and object tracking.

Integrate the UI with the trained model.
