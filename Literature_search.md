## Segmentation-Based Tracking Methods
This section explores different categories of segmentation-based tracking methods:

### Bottom-up
Bottom-up methods focus on contour matching and propagation.

#### Contour Matching
- [Write about contour matchin]

#### Contour Propagation
- [Anil will Write about contour matchin]

### Joint-Based Methods
[Vincent Write about contour matchin]

## Notes
- It's important to note that graph-cut segmentation can be relatively slow, and binary segmentation may increase the risk of drift due to wrongly segmented image regions.
