My node js was not working because my operating system had trouble acessing my public key. I tried uninstalling nodejs and reinstalling node js.
This still didn't work. Ultimately my mentor solved the problem for me after fiddling for one and a half hours. 
Here is a list of things fixed:
1. program manager did not update
2. key ring did not properly funciton
3. npm version was not updated
4. node version was out dated
5. curl did not bypass the need of a ring key
