The first thing I tried is just html and css on it's own.
To confirm that there was not html and css problems I made a model of the video code in another file.
The html website worked perfectly thus confirming that the problem was in react.

This website had it run from the css source, but this didn't work

This guide had the video imported into the react frame work, but ultimately this gave an error with importing react

This website had a ton of different libraries that avoided using the video tag. After trying each one I realized
that the problem was with the fact that my video was local and not online, so I searched specifically for local 
react video tag.

This guide does not give an errors, but it also does not properly run the video. 

The problem was the placement of the input div. It could not be in the same div as the actual video player.
